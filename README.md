# streamdata.io-events

> events API layer on top of streamdata

Events based API layer around [`streamdataio-js-sdk`](https://github.com/streamdataio/streamdataio-js-sdk) that handles `JSON Patch` by using [`fast-json-patch`](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/JSON-Patch).

## Usage

_note: this currently only works in the browser, would be cool to have it working in node.js soon!_

```js
var streamdata = require('streamdata.io-events')

var url = 'https://www.reddit.com/r/random.json?obey_over18=true'
var key = 'API key from https://streamdata.io/' // ðŸ”‘

var SSE = streamdata(url, key)

SSE
  .on('data', function (data) {
    console.log('data', data)
  })
  .on('error', function (err) {
    console.error(err)
  })

// close SSE after 5 seconds 
setTimeout(function () {
  SSE.close()
}, 5000)
```


## API

```js
var streamdata = require('streamdata.io-events')
var SSE = streamdata(url, key)
```

`streamdata.io-events` is an event emitter!


### `SSE.on('data', callback(data))`

Occurs whenever a full JSON doc is available.  Is called when the SSE opens, and whenever a `JSON Patch` gets applied to the previous exisiting JSON doc. Uses `fast-json-patch` internally.


### `SSE.on('error', callback(err))`
Occurs whenever the SSE returns an error, sends an `Error` object in the callback.


### `SSE.on('patch', callback(patch))`
Occurs whenever a new patch becomes available. Use this if you want to have access to the patch directly. Normally you can just listen for the `data` event as it will pass you a patched JSON doc by using `fast-json-patch` internally.

### `SSE.on('opened', callback())`
Occurs whenever the stream is opened.

### `SSE.emit('open') || SSE.open()`
Opens the stream (is called automatically once when the SSE is instantiated).

### `SSE.emit('close') || SSE.close()`
Closes the stream.
